        NeoCrypt Change Log
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * Added checks for duplicate passwords in list.
    * Refreshed UI to support new features.
    * Added message that encrypting with DES is no longer supported. Decryption is still supported.
       This is due to Cryptlib changes.

25 June 2005 (Release 1.1a)
    * Fixed "Installation path in registry" error in Shell
       extension.
    * Upgraded to Windows XP look & feel for newer operating
       systems.
        
03 June 2003 (Release 1.1 Beta)

    * Added a Windows Context Menu Shell Extension Handler which
       sends files and folders to NeoCrypt through Windows Explorer.
       (Sub-project NeocryptSX in the MSVC workspace)
      
    * The password list can be hidden and asterisks used in the
       "Add Password" dialog by checking the Options->Hide Passwords
       menu. The setting is saved in the registry.
      
    * Files/folders can be sent to NeoCrypt through Command-line.
      
    * Replaced all references to std::slist with std::list. Although
       reduces efficiency, it is more consistent with the ANSI C++
       STL. STLport 4.5.3 is no longer required to compile with
       VC.NET (MSVC6 still requires it as it has many bugs it its STL
       support).
      
    * Removed all references to "shlwapi.dll" to improve compatibility
       with older versions of Windows.
